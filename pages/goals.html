    <h1>My Coding Goals!</h1>
    <p>I am so excited to start Galvanize and it made my day, month, and year
      to be able to join the g42_SanFrancisco cohort!! I am really excited to embark
      on the new adventure and move my career in an amazing new direction!</p>

      <img class="gif" id="excited1" src="../Assets/Images/excited1.gif" alt="Celebrating getting into galvanize dance gif!"><p class="gif">The acceptance email got me like...</p>

      <p>My initial coding goals are to master the concepts covered in the program and build
      some really cool things. Initially my goal is to start at a large company and really get mentored
      by more experience coders and gain really good training.</p>

      <img class="gif" id="homer" src="../Assets/Images/homer.gif" alt="Homer Simpson Undo Undo"><p class="gif">Hopefully not making too many mistakes!</p>

      <p>My ultimate goal is to become like my brother and start a successful tech company built on something
      I am passionate about. In my past I have been involved in the Sports, Events, and Non-Profit world.
      I would love to launch an idea or product in one of those areas.</p>
